```
## **Prerequisites**
Install the following packages/tools:
- **Git** - You need this tool for managing the repository codes.
- **Python v3.7.7** - Since django uses python to run.

For DBMS you could choose one of these following options:
- **Sqlite3** - You will not install anything if you choose this option, by default django will provide it for you.
- **Postgresql v10.12** - **Recommended** for performance reason.

## **Setup**
Follow all these instructions if this is the first time you pull/fork this repository.
1. Create **env** folder in the root of project/repository for creating local environment, will use this for saving  all installed packages and will isolate the environment from global environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
2. Create **.env** file in the root of project/repository and fill in these variables:
    ```bash
    DEBUG=
    DBMS=
    DATABASE_NAME=
    DATABASE_USER=
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=
    DATABASE_HOST=
    DATABASE_PORT=
    ```
    
    e.g:
    ```bash
    DEBUG=True
    DBMS=POSTGRESQL
    DATABASE_NAME=cervicam
    DATABASE_USER=cervicam_user
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=password
    DATABASE_HOST=localhost
    DATABASE_PORT=5432
    ```

    Full documentation of **.env** file:

    | Variable          | Optional | Value                                                                             |
    |-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | DEBUG             | No          | Either **True** or **False**                                                              |
    | DBMS              | No          | Either **SQLITE3** or **POSTGRESQL**                                                      |
    | DATABASE_NAME     | Yes         | Create database on POSTGRESQL with any name you want and set it to this variable  |
    | DATABASE_USER     | Yes         | User's name to access the database on POSTGRESQL                                  |
    | DATABASE_PASSWORD | Yes         | User's password to access the database on POSTGRESQL                              |
    | DATABASE_HOST     | Yes         | The host of POSGRESQL server                                                      |
    | DATABASE_PORT     | Yes         | The port that used by the host                                                    |
After you done, activate your local environment by following instructions that defined in [here](#activate-local-environment) and also you need to install all required packages by calling commands that defined in [here](#add-and-install-environment)

## **Activate Local Environment**
Before you jump to use all available commands on [usage](#usage), you need to activate a local environment first by calling this command in the root of repository:
- Windows:
    ```bash
    env\Scripts\activate
    ```
- Unix:
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

## **Add and Install Packages**
Activate your local environment from [this section](#activate-local-environment) before add or install packages.
- Install all required packages from requirements.txt:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Add new package
    1. Add new package and the version of it on the requirements.txt. e.g:
        ```bash
        Django==3.0.8
        ```
    2. Finally, install all packages from requirements.txt
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
    

## **Usage**
Ensure you already activated the local environment from [this section](#activate-local-environment) before use all these useful commands:
- Run application and will be hosted at **localhost:8000** by default
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
- Make migrations after you created/changed something on models
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
- Migrate after there is a new changes of migration files
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
- Create superuser in order to use django admin or other stuffs that needs super user credential
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
